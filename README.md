# Canada-Resource-Allocation-for-Healthcare
Using partial observability MARL algorithms to optimize resource allocation problems in the Canadian healthcare system.
This project was initially made for a research idea at the University of Guelph for the course ENGG * 6600 Intro to AI

Much of this code was made with prior research and code sources like EpyMARL, MARLLib and MAPPO-Lite. The environment was made from scratch for this project.
